# FNB-Academy-Shopping-Cart-Week-8

This week I made a simple shopping cart programme that will continuously ask the user for a food prduct and the price of that product, I also added an exit clause so that if the user wishes to stop adding more things to their cart they can. and finally at the end the programme the users are able to see the food and the total cost.
